ClassicTaste.net was created to provide classical music sub-genre predictions not derived from user preferences. The project takes song metadata from the Spotify Web API, identifies identical song names, and uses albums on which that song resides to create links between other songs that share those albums. These song nodes create a network that allows for inference on subgenre of music. I perform community detection on the resultant network using the igraph Python module and the Infomap community detection algorithm. This produces a large number of "communities" of songs. Majority voting is leveraged using genre-tagged albums such as "Avant-Garde Classics" or "History of the Classical Period" to within each defined community. Communities with the same genre are then aggegated for main sub-genre playlists. Song recommendations from those lists are derived from the non-aggregated community of the song selected.
